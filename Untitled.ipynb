    "# 🤖 Capstone Project: AgentRed - AI-Powered Debate System using Generative AI\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the **Kaggle 5-Day Generative AI Intensive Course**, this capstone project explores an innovative application of GenAI: simulating debates between opposing public narratives using AI agents. The system not only gathers and analyzes online opinions but also engages in a logic-based debate to determine which side presents a more compelling argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The key features of this AI debate system are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dominant Sentiments Detection**  \n",
    "   Extract and analyze the prevailing public sentiments around a specific topic or event from online platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Popular Opinion Mining**  \n",
    "   Identify the most influential or frequently expressed opinions to represent both sides of a debate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **AI Debate Simulation**  \n",
    "   Generate a debate between two AI agents representing each dominant narrative. A third AI agent acts as a **Judge**, evaluating the arguments and delivering a **verdict** on which side won based on logic, consistency, and supporting evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Core Concepts Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prompt Engineering**: Carefully crafted prompts guide the behavior of each AI agent to ensure coherent and context-aware responses.\n",
    "- **Agents**: Specialized AI components with designated roles: data retriever, debaters, and judge.\n",
    "- **Chat Persistence (Memory)**: Maintains contextual understanding across multiple exchanges, simulating a more natural and informed conversation.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Model Initialization**:\n",
    "   - We initialize the `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` model with specific settings:\n",
    "     - **Model**: `gemini-2.0-flash-lite`\n",
    "     - **Temperature**: `0` (This ensures the model gives deterministic outputs with minimal randomness.)\n",
    "     - **Max Tokens**: `None` (No token limit for responses.)\n",
    "     - **Timeout**: `None` (No timeout set for the model's responses.)\n",
    "     - **Max Retries**: `2` (Retries the model's request up to 2 times in case of failure.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Debate Chains**:\n",
    "   - **Support Chain**: This chain generates the initial supporting argument for a particular stance. It includes:\n",
    "     - **SystemMessage**: The system sets the context and debate prompt using the `ai_prompt_support` template.\n",
    "     - **HumanMessage**: A placeholder for the human input, which asks the model to respond to the latest argument and advance the position.\n",
    "     - The chain is connected to the `model` for generating AI responses.\n",
    "   - **Counter Chain**: Similarly, the counter chain generates opposing arguments. It uses the `ai_prompt_counter` template and follows the same structure as the support chain.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Debate Initialization**:\n",
    "   - An empty list `debate_history` is initialized to track the debate's progress (i.e., each argument, rebuttal, and counter-rebuttal).\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **First Round - Initial Arguments**:\n",
    "   - The first round begins by generating arguments for both sides:\n",
    "     - **Support Response**: The model generates an initial supporting argument based on the `support_chain`.\n",
    "     - **Counter Response**: The counter-argument is generated using the `counter_chain`.\n",
    "   - Both arguments are appended to the `debate_history` for the next round.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Subsequent Rounds**:\n",
    "   - For each round (5 rounds in total, adjustable):\n",
    "     - **Support Rebuttal**: After each counter-argument, the support chain is used to generate a rebuttal.\n",
    "     - **Counter Rebuttal**: Similarly, the counter chain is used for a rebuttal to the support rebuttal.\n",

After collecting the full debate history, a dedicated `judgment_chain` prompts the model to analyze both opinions—labeled \"SUPPORT\" and \"COUNTER\"—and declare which made the most compelling, logical, and rational case. The AI judge presents its decision using a structured format with clear headings: **Chad** (winner), **Virgin** (loser), and **Reasoning**, along with assessments of **Argument Strength**, **Logical Coherence**, and **Persuasiveness**. This ensures the verdict not only identifies the stronger side but also provides insight into why the winning opinion prevailed, offering a detailed and entertaining conclusion to the AI debate."

The COUNTER argument, on the other hand, consistently predicted the devaluation and eventual obsolescence of the engineer, focusing on automation and efficiency.

The COUNTER argument, while making valid points about automation, was overly pessimistic and failed to account for the complexities of real-world software development.\n",

It acknowledged the challenges but presented a path forward for engineers, emphasizing the value of human skills in the age of AI.
